# Go to [Dask Binder](https://examples.dask.org/)

Launch the Binder instance at the [Dask Example Page](https://examples.dask.org/) and go from there!

Done. If you would prefer to have a local version of the Python environment we are using, see below for setup instructions.


# At home setup

To complete the exercises presented in the workshop, you may create a Python environment with the following packages:

```sh
conda create -n quantum python=3.9 numpy scipy pandas scikit-learn seaborn dask jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

At the time of this workshop, the major package versions were:

```default
dask=2022.10.0
jupyterlab=3.4.8
matplotlib-base=3.5.3
numpy=1.23.4
pandas=1.5.1
python=3.9.13
scikit-learn=1.1.2
scipy=1.9.3
seaborn=0.12.1
```

Other combinations may also work.
